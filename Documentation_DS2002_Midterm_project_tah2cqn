The Sakila DB is a transactional database for a movie rental business. (Like Blockbuster)

The Sakila MySQL database was retrieved from somewhere on the internet. I do not have the original link for reference at the moment, but I do have the .zip I downloaded with all the info on it so I will put that on github.

File names mentioned below will be listed on the github

STEPS TO RUN:

Run SQL Query: sakila_schema.sql
>>>creates sakila source database in MySQL

Run SQL Query: sakila-data.sql
>>>inserts data into sakila source database in MySQL

Run Python Script: DS2002 Midterm Project (draft).(pythonfile)
>>>creates sakila_project database in MySQL
>>>creates dim tables
>>>creates fact table
#NOTE: Sometimes the MongoDb connection doesn't create correctly and I get the error "string indice needs to be integer on #'atlas'" or something like that
#Just re-running the mongodb connection code block specifically then going back to the problem block usually fixes it

Run SQL Query: create_sakila_dim_date.sql
>>>creates dim_date

Run SQL Query: Integrate_sakila_dim_date.sql
#I am having a client-side query time-out exception problem with this. From my google research it is a MySQL MacOS version bug #and you have to wipe MySQL workbench and install an old version to work. That being said, it should work from a code #perspective I think. (It has worked sporadically for me)
#If I am completely wrong and it does NOT work, it does not break anything else. There will just be some empty columns in the fact table

Run SQL Query: sakila_project_query.sql
>>> Goal: Show an aggregate query with fact table + joined with at least 2 dim tables
>>>My query: aggregate the total amount of payments made by customers and then order by total payment desc to find out who spent the most money at this business
